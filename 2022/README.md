# Advent of Code

Welcome to my Advent of Code solutions for 2022

This year I'm doing it in TypeScript, and trying to stick to just types, arrays/maps, and higher order functions where it's reasonable to do so.

## Setup

- install dependencies: `pnpm i`
- run a solution: `pnpm i -g tsx`, `tsx 01/day01.ts` (etc for other days)
- run tests in watch mode: `pnpm test`
